Angular Tutorial about Communication between Components

### Description
When I started learning Angular, I had trouble finding simple methods to make components communicate with each other. Now, I am more experienced so I made this tutorial to help novice web developers choose a method depending on their needs. It includes 6 different methods from easiest to hardest.

### Build Steps
* Install Angular
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
* Create new project
```
ng new myproject
```
* Copy downloaded files inside `src` and paste them in your `myproject/src` folder.
* Using terminal, go to your `myproject` folder and type:
```
ng serve --open
```
You are ready, the application must be running at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/)
